## **Instalation Method**

1. **First** you have to download the git repo using git clone command in your terminal.
`git clone https://github.com/fredalbert37/docker-compose_node_app.git`

2. **Second** you have to run `npm install` or `npm update` in the the directory docker-compose_node_app.

Finally if you have already installed **docker** and **docker-compose** on your system only run `docker-compose build` and then `docker-compose up`.

Thats all from now, then I would be updating this repo to bring more tools that will help you in your development.
